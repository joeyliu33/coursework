    <h3>Peer Review Reflection</h3>
    <p>It is my first time to participate peer review activity. At first, I am not used to explain my work with my classmates. However, after several participation, I found I can demonstrate more fluently. Through the activities, I learnt a lot as a reviewer ad reviewee. 
    </p>
    <p>As a reviewer, I learnt how to ask the questions regarding the main point for each workshop. In the past, I thought I just need to listen to my classmate without asking any questions. When they finished their demonstration, I finished my work. Later I found this is not the best way. Actually, I can still learn a lot as the reviewer. Therefore, when my classmates demonstrate their work, I will try to ask some questions about how they solve the problems or whether they encounter any issues during their work. During the discussion, 
    I will find some similar problems that I also encountered during my work. Therefore, I do learn a lot when I was a reviewer.
    </p>
    <p>As a reviewee, I really improved the skill of how I explain my work to others in a better way. In the past, I could hardly explain to others of my work. However, since I got the chance to do the peer review, my demonstration skill has improved. I know what the key point of my demonstration is and how to make it clearly. Also, during my demonstration, I can find out which point is not familiar.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I want to talk about how I improved my peer review experience. First of all, students should be confident when communicating with others. If they are afraid of communicating with others, they may not explain themselves clearly. Secondly, as the reviewer, instead of listening to your reviewee for most of the time, you can try to ask some questions about how the work is done or any problems during the work. As a result, you may find some similar problems that you encounter. Then you can discuss regarding the issues. In addition, as a reviewee, how you explain yourself is the key point. Some people may talk a lot which are pointless. It is important to follow the assessment step by step to demonstrate each procedure of your work. In general, peer review is a good activity for students to learn more and learn in depth.
